** Weekly Work Planning 
* C_ Lean, Mean, BA Machine
** Understand the big picture. What is the value proposition?
** Think backwards. From the big picture, what is the minimum possible path back to today for success?
** Constant improvement. Less waste is more value. Ask “why” over and over (root-cause analysis).
** Flow. Always moving; always improving. Cycles of work. Agility. Regular conversations (circles) vs. waterfalls/critical-paths (lines). Pull instead of push.
